This is my sudoku app for the MY-RES Project at Queensland University of Technology. It is fairly simple as it's only intended for the use of the current study I'm working on which is about user's frustration during a challenging game. 

To start this project, please type "npm install" in the terminal of the folder to download all the required node modules and then type "npm run dev" to start the app.
